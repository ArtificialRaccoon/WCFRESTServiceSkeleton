# WCF RESTService Skeleton
A simple skeleton for a WCF based REST Service.  Provides examples for GET, POST, and SyndicationFeed.  This should allow anyone to get a REST service up and running in seconds.  Originally built with Mono and MonoDevelop, but should work without an issue with Visual Studio and DotNet.

As this code is clearly a functionless skeleton, I release this code without any caveats.  For those who care, I have attached the MIT license to make things simple.
